# Going live on PythonAnywhere

This walks you through putting the site on the internet using
[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), a beginner-friendly
Python host with a free tier. No credit card needed to start, and it
gives you free HTTPS out of the box, which the admin login needs.

Total time: 20–30 minutes the first time.

## 1. Create your account

1. Go to **pythonanywhere.com** and sign up for a **Beginner (free)**
   account.
2. Confirm your email if asked, then log in. You'll land on the
   **Dashboard**.

Your free account gives you a site at `https://<yourusername>.pythonanywhere.com`
— that's a real, working, HTTPS web address you can share immediately.
(A custom domain like `www.ladli.com` needs a paid PythonAnywhere plan
and separate domain registration — optional, see step 8.)

## 2. Upload the project

1. Click the **Files** tab.
2. Create a new folder, e.g. `ladli`.
3. Open that folder, click **Upload a file**, and upload this zip
   (`LADLI_visitor-management_fixed.zip`).
4. Click **Consoles** → **Bash** to open a terminal, then unzip it:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ladli
   unzip LADLI_visitor-management_fixed.zip
   mv LADLI_visitor-management_fixed/* .
   mv LADLI_visitor-management_fixed/.env* .
   rmdir LADLI_visitor-management_fixed
   ```

## 3. Install dependencies

Still in the Bash console:
```bash
cd ~/ladli
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Set your real environment variables

Edit `.env` (via the Files tab, or `nano .env` in the console) and set:
```
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<choose a strong password here, or leave this line out entirely>
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
MAIL_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME=LADLI Electrical Testing and Calibration Laboratory
MAIL_REPLY_TO=your-email@gmail.com
```
If you leave `ADMIN_PASSWORD` out, the app generates a strong one-time
password itself and prints it to the log the first time it starts (see
step 7) — you'll be forced to set your own password the moment you log
in either way, so either approach is safe.

## 5. Create the web app

1. Click the **Web** tab → **Add a new web app** → **Next**.
2. When asked to choose a framework, pick **Manual configuration**
   (not the "Flask" wizard — this project already has its own
   `app.py`/WSGI setup) → choose the latest available Python 3
   version → **Next**.

## 6. Point it at this project

On the Web tab, in the **Code** section:
- **Source code**: `/home/<yourusername>/ladli`
- **Working directory**: `/home/<yourusername>/ladli`
- **Virtualenv**: `/home/<yourusername>/ladli/.venv`

Click the **WSGI configuration file** link — it opens an editor.
Delete everything in it, and paste in the contents of this project's
`wsgi_pythonanywhere.py`. Then change this one line near the top to
your real path:
```python
project_home = os.environ.get('PYTHONANYWHERE_PROJECT_HOME', '/home/<yourusername>/ladli')
```
Save the file.

In the **Static files** section, add these two mappings so images/CSS/JS
load quickly (served directly instead of through Flask):
| URL | Directory |
|---|---|
| `/assets/` | `/home/<yourusername>/ladli/site/assets/` |
| `/admin/assets/` | `/home/<yourusername>/ladli/admin/assets/` |

## 7. Go live

Click the big green **Reload** button at the top of the Web tab.
Then open `https://<yourusername>.pythonanywhere.com` in a new tab —
the site should load.

To find your admin login the first time: on the Web tab, scroll to
**Log files** → open the **Error log**. Search (Ctrl+F) for
"First run" — you'll see the generated username/password there.
Go to `https://<yourusername>.pythonanywhere.com/admin/login`, sign
in with those, and you'll be immediately prompted to set your own
password before you can do anything else.

## 8. Optional: a custom domain

If you'd rather have `www.yourcompany.com` instead of the
`.pythonanywhere.com` address:
1. Buy a domain from any registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google
   Domains, etc.) — usually $10–15/year.
2. Upgrade to a paid PythonAnywhere plan (custom domains aren't
   available on the free tier).
3. Follow PythonAnywhere's **Web tab → Add a new web app → your
   domain** flow, and update your domain's DNS records as PythonAnywhere
   instructs (a CNAME or A record pointing at their servers).
4. PythonAnywhere issues you a free HTTPS certificate for the custom
   domain automatically.

This step is entirely optional — the `.pythonanywhere.com` address
works fully on the free tier with no domain purchase required.

## 9. After you're live — a short checklist

- [ ] Logged into `/admin` once and set your own password
- [ ] Confirmed the contact form and quote form emails arrive
      (check the SMTP settings in `.env` if not)
- [ ] Replaced the placeholder domain in `site/sitemap.xml` and the
      canonical/JSON-LD tags with your real live URL
- [ ] Bookmarked the PythonAnywhere **Web tab** — you'll come back
      here any time you upload new files and need to hit **Reload**

## Keeping the site updated later

Whenever you want to push changes:
1. Upload the changed files via the Files tab (or `git pull` if
   you're using version control).
2. Go to the **Web** tab and click **Reload**.

That's it — no downtime, no server restarts needed.
